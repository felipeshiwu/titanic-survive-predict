One of challenges hosted by Kaggle is The Titanic competition in which the goal is to predict the survival or death of the passengers based on a set of features describing him, like name, age, sex, class on the boat... see all at [Kaggle Titanic Challenge page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

Based of one of the most complete and high scored kernel in the leaderboard, [soham1024](https://www.kaggle.com/soham1024/titanic-data-science-eda-with-meme-solution/notebook). What I'm doing here is my process of studing this kernel, so for all information, please back to the source.

## Competition description highlights
- After Titanic colliding with an iceberg, 1502 people of 2224 died (32%).
  - The sample have 891, 40% of total passenger on board the Titanic.
  - From the sample, around 38% survived.
- One of the reason is because there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
- Without considering the element of luck involved, some groups of people were more likely to survive comparing with anothers.
  - From the movie, women and children first.
- The features of train data set are all present in test dataset.
